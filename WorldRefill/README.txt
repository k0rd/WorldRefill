/* CHANGELOG */

Why Version 2.0? Here's why:

Using a switch statement instead of a command for each possible generation, makes things look alot neater :)

Maxtries now can be customised in the config json file! this controls how many attempts it has at generating an object.

Pots now actually generate their biome variants, no longer do we have the default pot in hell or in the dungeon!

Input validation has been implemented - checks are now in place to make sure that strings and 0/negative integers stay away! go away :(

the old trap generation used to just generate geysers, we now have a random number implemented so that it will switch between the various 
cave traps!

Temple traps have been implemented, this is completely new for this plugin, i went through the effort of checking for lihzahrd bricks in the vicinity of
the trap only to realize that the method itself did it for me :(

Lava traps have been implemented, this is also completely new for this plugin

Altered the altar generation making it so that in crimson worlds it will create crimson altars instead of demon altars

Also some minor changes that mainly affect the clarity of the feedback to the user.

Regex has been implemented and error generation has been changed so that errors are more dynamic.

Statues are fundamentally changed, they now utilize Terraria's built-in statuelist meaning that even if terraria updates to add statues,
they will also be added to the list. the spawning of specific statues now uses a dictionary, and includes more statues.

/* WIP */

The rest of the options need to be implemented, this should take a couple of days max hopefully if i do not run into any bugs.
I also plan to add some more new features, like the ability to regenerate a whole new complete temple! and others
